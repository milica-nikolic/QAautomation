# One of the workloads that I have found to cover the required functionalities in the task is CronJobs.

# CronJobs manage Jobs on a scheduled basis, following the same model as a LinuxÂ crontab.

# Using CronJobs, we can schedule a job to run once a day, a week, or a month.

# An example of a cronJob would look like this. I filled it with information I knew at the time (schedule attribute for example).
